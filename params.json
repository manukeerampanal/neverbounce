Submit single email address at a time. (Verify an email)\r\n2. Batch email address submission. (Verifying a list)\r\n\r\n    In the 2nd section, we can submit data in 2 means.\r\n\r\n    - Store the file to a csv list and store it to a place where it can be accessed publically. Then submit the URL for file to the neverbounce.comIn this method, the neverbounce.com will access the '.csv' file from their part to process it.\r\n    - Directly submit the entire list as POST method to the neverbounce.com\r\n\r\n## API Initiation and Authentication\r\n\r\n    $neverbounce = neverbounce->new( %options ) or die \"Failed to initialize\";\r\n\r\nThis method intiates the request to the neverbounce.com and gets the `access_token` which is required for further processing. The `access_token` is normally valid for an hour and used for any number of requests.\r\n\r\nThe following options correspond to attribute methods described below:\r\n\r\n    +---------------+----------------------------------------+\r\n    |Key            | Value                                  |\r\n    +---------------+----------------------------------------+\r\n    |api_username   | <API Username>                         |\r\n    |api_secret_key | <API Secret Key>                       |\r\n    +---------------+----------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nNevebounce uses OAuth 2.0 authentication model. This requires you to make an initial request for an `access token` before making verification requests.\r\n**API Username** and **API Secret Key** are available at 'API Credentials' in the user account of neverbounce.com\r\n\r\n## Verifying an Email\r\n\r\n    my %email_verify_result = $neverbounce->nb_verify_email( email => 'test@example.com' );\r\n\r\nThis method is used to validate an email address in realtime. The parameter `email` is mandatory to process this function.\r\n\r\nThe response for the function will be returned as a hash and they are,\r\n\r\n    (\r\n        resp_status     =>  'success',  # status for the request. Expected values are 'success' and 'error'\r\n        data            =>  {\r\n            result_code                 =>  __,\r\n                # The result code.

Each row can only contain a single email and all emails should be in the same column.\r\n\r\nClick following link to learn more about formatting your list. ([https://neverbounce.com/help/getting-started/uploading-a-file/](https://neverbounce.com/help/getting-started/uploading-a-file/))\r\n\r\nOnce aggregated this list can be submitted either directly as a URL encoded string or by submitting a public URL to the CSV. For larger lists the latter method is preferred. If you receive a `413 Request Entity Too Large` http error, you should try submitting a public URL to the CSV instead.\r\n\r\nWhen you submit a list via the API the verification process will start automatically. If your credit balance is insufficient the verification of your list will fail. You can purchase credits in bulk from the dashboard or submit a request([https://app.neverbounce.com/settings/billing](https://app.neverbounce.com/settings/billing)) to use neverbounce.com monthly billing option. You can also choose to run a free analysis rather than verifying your list, see [https://neverbounce.com/help/api/running-a-free-analysis/](https://neverbounce.com/help/api/running-a-free-analysis/).\r\n\r\n    my %email_verify_send = $neverbounce->nb_email_list_batch_send( %option );\r\n\r\nThis method is used when there is more than one email address to be verified at a single request. The options permitted are as follows :\r\n\r\n    %option = (\r\n        input_location => 0,\r\n        input => 'http://www.example.com/folder/file_123_999.csv',\r\n        filename => 'NB_01_01_2016.csv'\r\n    );\r\n\r\nThe parameters `input_location` and `input` are mandatory and `filename` is optional.\r\n\r\n- The permited value for the parameter `input_location` is either **0** or **1**.\r\n- If `input_location` is set as **0**, then value of `input` is expected to be the a URL to the list.\r\n- If `input_location` is set as **1**, then value of `input` is expected to be the a URL encoded string of the contents of the list.\r\n- `filename` is optional, but do suggest supplying it as it will be useful for identifying your list in the user account dashboard of the neverbounce.com.\r\n\r\nThe response for the function will be returned as a hash and they are,\r\n\r\n    (\r\n        resp_status     =>  'success', # status for the request. Expected values are 'success' and 'error'\r\n        data            =>  {\r\n            job_status                  =>  __,\r\n                # Processing status of the current submitted email batch file. Response will be '0'\r\n            job_id                      =>  __,\r\n                # Job id assigned by the neverbounce.com for the submitted process\r\n            neverbounce_execution_time  =>  __\r\n                # Time consumed by neverbounce.com for processing request\r\n        },\r\n        request_data    =>  __\r\n            # this contains Dumper() value of HTTP request-response between the neverbounce.com and requesting server\r\n    )\r\n\r\nOnce you get a response you'll want to store the value of `job_id`, as it will be used to check the status and eventually retrieve the results. Now you're ready to start checking the status of the verification.\r\n\r\n### Checking the status\r\n\r\nNow that your list is running, you will need to poll the API and check the status periodically. For **smaller lists** (<50k) polling **every 5-10 seconds is acceptable**, but for **larger lists** (>50k) you'll want to **poll less frequently**.\r\n\r\n    my %email_verify_send_check = $neverbounce->nb_email_list_batch_check(job_id => '123456');\r\n\r\nThis method is used to check the processing status of the email list batch file. The paramtere `job_id` is mandatory for the function to process. [Click Here](https://metacpan.org/pod/Adding&#x20;a&#x20;List) to know how to retrive the value for `job_id`.\r\n\r\nThe response for the function will be returned as a hash and they are,\r\n\r\n    (\r\n        resp_status     =>  'success', # status for the request. Expected values are 'success' and 'error'\r\n        data            =>  {\r\n            status                      =>  __,\r\n                # The processing status for the requested job. Expected values: 0 /  1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5\r\n            status_desc                 =>  __,\r\n                # The descripton for the parameter 'status'\r\n            id                          =>  __,\r\n            type                        =>  __,\r\n            input_location              =>  __,\r\n            orig_name                   =>  __,\r\n            created                     =>  __,\r\n            started                     =>  __,\r\n            finished                    =>  __,\r\n            file_details                =>  __,\r\n            job_details                 =>  __,\r\n            neverbounce_execution_time  =>  __, # Time consumed by neverbounce.com for processing request\r\n            stats                       =>  {\r\n                total       =>  __, # total records submitted\r\n                processed   =>  __, # total records processed\r\n                valid       =>  __, # no of valid records among processed records\r\n                invalid     =>  __, # no of invalid records among processed records\r\n                bad_syntax  =>  __, # no of bad syntaxed records among processed records\r\n                catchall    =>  __, # no of catchall records among processed records\r\n                disposable  =>  __, # no of disposable records among processed records\r\n                unknown     =>  __, # no of unknown records among processed records\r\n                duplicates  =>  __, # no of duplicate records among processed records\r\n                billable    =>  __, # no of billable records among processed records\r\n                job_time    =>  __, # time used to process the processed records\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        request_data    =>   __\r\n            # this contains Dumper() value of HTTP request - response between the neverbounce.com and requesting server\r\n    )\r\n\r\nIn the response, the `status` parameter will indicate what the list is currently doing. You can find a table of status `codes` below. Typically `status` will be the only parameter you will need to watch. However, you may find the `stats` object useful for seeing a breakdown of the results in your list while it's processing. You can also use the `processed` and `billable` values in the `stats` object to track the progress of the verification.\r\n\r\nOnce the `status` value is `4` you're ready to [retrieve the results](https://metacpan.org/pod/retrieving_the_results).\r\n\r\n#### Status Codes\r\n\r\n    +---------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n    | Value         | Description                                                                                |\r\n    +---------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n    | 0             | Request has been received but has not started idexing                                      |\r\n    | 1             | List is indexing and deduping                                                              |\r\n    | 2             | List is awaiting user input (Typically skipped for lists submitted via API)                |\r\n    | 3             | List is being processed                                                                    |\r\n    | 4             | List has completed verification                                                            |\r\n    | 5             | List has failed (Click following link to learn how to fix a failed list)                   |\r\n    |               | <https://neverbounce.com/help/getting-started/uploading-a-file/#fixing-a-failed-list>      |\r\n    +---------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n### Retrieving the Results\r\n\r\nOnce the [\"Checking the status\"](#checking-the-status) returns the value for the parameter `status` as `4`, we can retive the results from the neverbounce.com.\r\n\r\n    my %email_verify_send_result = $neverbounce->nb_email_list_batch_result( %option );\r\n\r\nThis method is used to retirive the result from the neverbounce.com.

To make sure your request is a success, check the value for the parameter `resp_status`. It will be **success**, if your request processed succesfully. If it's **error**, Then your request has failed to processed. You can find the error data from the response.\r\n\r\nThe response will be as follows when an error occur:\r\n\r\n    (\r\n        resp_status     =>  'error', \r\n        data            =>  {\r\n            error               => __, # defiens error type\r\n            error_description   => __  # Describes the reson for the error\r\n        },\r\n        request_data    =>  __\r\n            # this contains Dumper() value of HTTP request - response between the neverbounce.com and requesting server\r\n    )\r\n\r\nThe parameter `request_data` will be filled with value when the request is passed to never bounce. Else it will be left blank. It will be mostly left bank only when you missed some mandatory values.\r\n\r\nThere is a condition when the module returns nothing. It will be occured when you call the method `neverbounce-`new()> and there the method faces following situations :\r\n\r\n1. Failed to establish the connection with neverbounce.com\r\n2. Connection established but no data retrived from neverbounce.com\r\n3. Values provided for `api_username` and `api_secret_key` are invalid or expired.\r\n\r\nIn this case you can find the error in your server error logs (_if it's present_);\r\n\r\n# AUTHOR\r\n\r\nManu Mathew, `<whitewind at cpan.org>`\r\n\r\n# BUGS\r\n\r\nPlease report any bugs or feature requests to `bug-neverbounce at rt.cpan.org`, or through\r\nthe web interface at [http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=neverbounce](http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=neverbounce).
